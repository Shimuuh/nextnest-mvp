# NextNest Project Summary

NextNest is an innovative, full-stack platform dedicated to bridging the gap between donors, orphanages, and orphaned children. By combining a modern web interface with an intelligent AI engine, the project streamlines operations, enhances transparency, and maximizes the positive impact on children's lives.

## Core Functions:

*   **Role-Based Portals:** Dedicated, secure dashboards for Admins, Orphanages, and Donors. These portals provide tailored insights, analytics, and control over daily operations, incoming donations, and child profile management.
*   **AI-Driven Government Scheme Matching:** The platform automatically evaluates a child's profile (including age, education, and required documents) against active government schemes. This proactively identifies matching welfare programs, housing grants, and scholarships that the child is eligible for.
*   **Intelligent AI Assistant:** An integrated AI chatbot that assists users, answers specialized queries, and processes automated workflows such as routing education donations or handling emergency medical funding.
*   **Real-Time Notifications:** Utilizing Socket.io, the system provides instant, real-time alerts for new child registrations and incoming donations, ensuring stakeholders are constantly kept in the loop.
*   **Risk Assessment & Transition Planning:** AI-assisted modules help predict potential risks in a child's development and assist administrators in planning smooth transitions for care leavers into future opportunities.

Overall, NextNest leverages cutting-edge technology to create a proactive and efficient ecosystem for child welfare and institutional support.
